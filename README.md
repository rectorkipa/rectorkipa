Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an engineer with a higher technical degree, and I am building a career in Data Science to help companies solve analytical and research problems. My main advantage is ability to learn quickly and effectively integrate into new processes. Because I have critical thinking and analytical mind.

I can be useful because I can parse information; analyze, process and visualize data; build, train and validate ML(DL, RecSys) models, evaluate their effectiveness; apply mathematics, for example, to formulate hypotheses and A/B testing. I work in Python, I know its ML libraries and DL frameworks, SQL, Git.
